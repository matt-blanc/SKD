# This is an open source split keyboard design (shortened to SKD for now).
# Currently under development for Rev A for both schematic and pcb layout.
# The current revision will overwrite old revisions but older revisions will be kept in separate sub-folders.
# Currently based off of other split keyboards such as Corne or ErgoDox, looking for ways to improve upon them.
